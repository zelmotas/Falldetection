# Fall Detection System Using Raspberry Pi

This project is a **Fall Detection System** developed using a Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and Python. The system leverages the accelerometer and gyroscope on the Sense HAT to detect sudden changes in motion that may indicate a fall. This can be particularly useful in healthcare settings or for monitoring the safety of elderly individuals.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zelmotas/falldetectionpi.git
    cd falldetectionpi
    ```


2. **Connect the Sense HAT:**
    Attach the Sense HAT to your Raspberry Pi as described in the official [Sense HAT guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/sense-hat/).

3. **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    python3 fall_detection.py
    ```

## Usage

This script continuously monitors the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the Sense HAT to detect falls. If a fall is detected, the system will log the event and can be configured to trigger an alert (e.g., send an email or SMS).

## How It Works

The system works by analyzing the acceleration data from the Sense HAT's sensors. When a significant spike in acceleration is detected, followed by a lack of motion (indicating that the person has not gotten up), the system registers a fall.

### Key Components:

- **Accelerometer and Gyroscope:** Used to detect sudden changes in motion.
- **Python Script:** Processes the sensor data to identify potential falls.

## Skills Improved

Working on this project has helped me enhance several important skills:

- **Python Programming:** Improved my ability to write and debug Python scripts, especially for hardware interaction.
- **Data Analysis:** Gained experience in processing and analyzing sensor data for real-time applications.
- **Embedded Systems:** Deepened my understanding of working with embedded systems, particularly using the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT.
- **Problem-Solving:** Developed problem-solving skills by addressing challenges related to sensor data interpretation and false-positive detection.
- **Project Management:** Strengthened my ability to plan, execute, and document a technical project from start to finish.
- **Git and GitHub:** Improved my proficiency in using version control (Git) and collaborating on projects using GitHub.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improve Accuracy:** Fine-tune the fall detection algorithm to reduce false positives and negatives.
- **Alert System:** Implement an alert system that can notify caregivers via email or SMS when a fall is detected.
- **User Interface:** Develop a simple GUI to allow users to configure and monitor the system easily.
- **Integration with Smart Devices:** Explore the possibility of integrating the system with smart home devices for a more comprehensive safety solution.
